# Invisibility_Cloak_using_Opencv
Having Watched harry potter I always had a deep desire of using an invisibility cloak. Well it turns out that using simple image processing tricks I can now actually fulfil my desire. This code turns a red colour cloth into an invisibility cloak.

For an option , we can use any of RGB colors for invisibility cloak by adjusting the pixels range.
## Basic concepts used in this fun project are:
#### 1. Capture and store the background frame.
#### 2. Detect the red coloured cloth using color detection algorithm.
#### 3. Segment out the red coloured cloth by generating a mask.
#### 4. Generate the final augmented output to create the magical effect
